			<div style="clear: both;" class="panel-body">This is a final group project built using Java and the IntelliJ IDE. We decided that we wanted to create a Java application that allowed users to order from a fast food restaurant. The
				requirements
				were to develop an
				app that demonstrated knowledge of object-oriented programming and test-driven development. We went a bit beyond that by building a graphical user interface to accompany our project. To view the project, simply download the jar file from
				the GitHub repository.</div>
