### Master the Basics

Recently, [Hacks4Pancakes made a point that](https://bsky.app/profile/hacks4pancakes.com/post/3m4jeuprdvk2x) I've heard other veteran cybersecurity folks reiterate: when getting into cybersecurity, the foundations are important. Their recommendation is that a traditional computer science degree can be more valuable than a cybersecurity degree. One commenter on that BlueSky thread said that it was easier to teach CS degree grads cybersecurity than to teach CS to cyber degree holders. 


In the field of malware analysis and reverse engineering, the fundamental basics are Assembly and Windows internals. (If you're specializing in a non-Windows malware ecosystem, then replace Windows with that particular operating system.) 

Two books I plan to read are the [Art of 64-Bit Assembly Language, Volume 1](https://nostarch.com/art-64-bit-assembly-volume-1), by Randall Hyde and [Windows Internals (7th ed.)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/resources/windows-internals) by Yosifovich, Ionescu, Russinovich and Solomon. To my mind, these encompass the foundational knowledge that industry leaders decry as missing from today's junior cyber applicants.  


### Gnash, Knead, Digest
Technical books like this require active reading.  No skimming.  You have to gnash and knead everything you read to make it stick, otherwise, it'll leak out of your ears. I'll jot down some notes here. I'll try to create some fun pencil drawings to organize the concepts.  It's a fun way to engage with the text, and it helps me remember.  


From the 64-Bit Assembly book, here are some of my random notes:

> "You should also be aware that, although the registers are called general-purpose, you cannot use any register for any purpose. All the x86-64 registers have their own special purpose that limit their use in certain contexts. The RSP register, for example, has a very special purpose that effectively prevents you from using it for anything else (it's the *stack pointer*). Likewise, the RBP regisetr has a special purpose that limts its usefulness as a general-purpose register. For the time being, avoid the use of RSP and RBP register for generic calculations; also, keep in mind that the remaining registers are not completely interchangeable in your programs."

> "In a typical program, anywhere from 25 percetn to 40 percent of the instructions are `mov` instructions." 

Here are some notes from my malware analysis course: 

> in x86 assembly, PUSH decrements the stack pointer (ESP) by 4 bytes (in 32-bit mode), then copies the value from the specified register into the newly allocated stack space. 

Caller cleans the stack by ADD instruction; that erases the memory added by the PUSHing the function variables just before the function call. 

Callee cleans the stack by RET 0x19 (or some other number in hex). A function that uses fastcall convention does not have to clean up as much because it did not push as many parameters onto the stack. 

`MOV EAX,0xccccc`  -- 0xCC is the INT3 instruction used for debugging (it generates a software interrupt)

### Try Something Different
Goint back to the Hacks4Pancakes discussion, commenters lamented that cybersecurity pipelines shuffle new graduates into malware analysis and pentesting.  They thought that was unfortunate given the diverse discliplines in the industry.  Point taken.  But I am interested in those two fields, as I'm sure many others are, because they are the most interesting.  Other fields, such as Government, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and Vulnerability Management are not nearly as exciting. Other fields often require experience in pentesting or malware analysis as cost of entry. 

For someone trying to break into the industry, definitely take whatever job you can get.  Cyber adjacent is better than cyberless.   


Also, note to self.  When I sat for the GREM last year, I regret two things:
1. Not bringing an Assembly reference book
2. Lack of familiarity with using Ghirda.  

I bought the Assembly book mentioned above, and I plan on completing a lot of Ghidra tutorial videos later this month.
