### Malware Lab Setup

Now that I passed the GWAPT exam, I can move on with my life.  I have two months to complete the [Malware Analysis from Intermediate to Expert](https://malwareanalysis-for-hedgehogs.learnworlds.com/) course.  Before I can start that I had to set up my home lab again.  

If you're setting up a home malware analysis lab, I highly recommend [Husky Hack's video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA0YcYMRWyI). It's a video walkthrough. The only problem is that I can't find Windows Enterprise version anymore, so I had to settle for Windows 10 Pro.  Kyle Cucci has also open sourced [Appendix A from his Evasive Malware book](https://nostarch.com/download/EvasiveMalware_AppendixA.pdf); this appendix offers some more tips on setting the malware lab.  

GitHub repositories to clone:
1. [Josh Stroschein's GitHub repository](https://nostarch.com/download/EvasiveMalware_AppendixA.pdf), specifically Learning Reverse Engineering and Learning Malware Analysis
2. [PMAT-labs from HuskyHacks](https://github.com/HuskyHacks/PMAT-labs) -- this accompanies the online video training linked above


### How to Get Started in Vulnerability Research

This week [Dunadan](https://x.com/udunadan) posted an insightful blog post [on getting started in vulnerability research](https://github.com/udunadan/notes/blob/main/How%20to%20Get%20Started%20In%20Vulnerability%20Research.md). "Passive activities only get you so far."  He asserts that you'll learn more and faster by doing.  It's painful and hard, but it's more effective

I've heard similar guidance from bug bounty folks. Like Dunadan, they advocate real-world practice is the most effective learning path.  


### Passing BurpSuite Certified Practitioner 

Flush with passing GWAPT, I started thinking about the BurpSuite Ceritifed Practitioner exam again. As I mentioned, I have failed it three times before.  

To prepare, I had completed all the Apprentice- and Practitioner-level labs, and I took so many Mystery Labs that I could almost guess the lab just from the blog post. 

What I am missing is a methodology for approaching an unknown web application.  Online searches yielded some notes on how to approach the exam as well as a helpful guide to the different classes of vulnerabilities encountered therein:

* [How to Pass the BSCP on Your 1st Try](https://medium.com/@kpawlo/how-to-pass-the-portswigger-burp-suite-certified-practicioner-on-your-1st-try-0a7c5d767bf7)
* [BSCP Review Tips](https://medium.com/@edgenask/burp-suite-certified-practitioner-bscp-review-tips-and-comparison-with-ewpt-7048d36314d2)
* [BSCP](https://github.com/DingyShark/BurpSuiteCertifiedPractitioner)
* [BSCP Exam Study](https://github.com/botesjuan/Burp-Suite-Certified-Practitioner-Exam-Study?tab=readme-ov-file)

I'll look those over and brush up on the labs again.  I have a free Saturday coming up, so I could give it another go.
