### How the Mountains Grew

[How the Mountains Grew: A New Geological History of North America](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-the-Mountains-Grew/John-Dvorak/9781639362158) by John Dvorak, is the best four-billion year history I read all year.  

Dvorak weaves detective work into each chapter. He presents some mystery from the geological record, outlines how geologists theorized about it until arriving at the current theory. He demonstrates how scientist leveraged observations to deduce an ancient record.  If you haven't studied geology since the fourth grade, you've missed on some major developments in the field.  

This book visits more alien planets than a Star Trek move, except all the alien planets are our own. At one point, Earth was mostly covered in water; another time it was a giant snowball. The sky was once red; the oceans were toxic.  The oxygen content of the atmosphere used to be much higher (and much lower) than what it is today. This book is way more engrossing than whatever is going on with Olivia Nuzzi and Ryan Lizza.   

Dvorak pushes you out the door and onto the open road. In the prologue, he expresses his hope to encourage readers to visit the many sites he mentions and see the geological evidence firsthand. He mentions numerous places throughout North America were sundry artifacts exist. Many, but not all, are in the western half of the continent. 

Somewhat unusual for a history book, it previews the near future.  Extrapolating on current trends, he outlines the future of the North American plate (goodbye, California), the Afro-eurasian plate (goodbye, Mediterranean Sea), and casually mentions that all oceans will disappear in a billion years.

I cannot recommend this book enough. Stop whatever you're doing and check it out now. 

### Russia and Putin

Putin, by Philip Short, is a plodding tome that is as exciting as an encyclopedia article.  [As the New York Times review notes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/01/books/review/putin-philip-short.html), there are factual errors and some false equivalencies. It delves into the post-war Saint Petersburg area that Putin was raised in, and it was a helpful primer on the Yeltsin-era chaos.

[Putin's World: Russia Against the West and With the Rest by Angela Stent](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/angela-stent/putins-world/9781455533015/?lens=twelve) is the superior book, and it reinforces my belief that policy experts and histories write better books than journalists. Unlike Short, Stent wastes no time in getting right to the point. She identifies the critical features of Russian thinking and foreign policy.
