Dr. [Christopher Goscha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Goscha), a professor of history at the Université du Québec à Montréal, has written an expansive and compelling history of Vietnam.


## Beyond the Second Indochina War
My knowledge of Vietnamese history is confined to the Second Indochina War. A Bright Shining Lie, The Best and The Brightest, and A Grand Dellusion -- these retell the Vietnam War are from the America. Given that broader ignorance, it was fascinating to read up on what happened before the war and what happened after.


## Foreign Intervention 
Goscha's book spans over a thousand years. Throughout he identifies several themes that have shaped the nation. Notably, he focuses on the influence of foreign intervention. China, France, Japan, the United States all shaped the creation of Vietnam. Goscha also talks about Vietnamese colonization. The Viet people actually originated in the northern Red River delta before spreading south to the Mekong delta and west into the highlands. In doing so, they were themselves colonizers over indigenous, non-Viet peoples.  

Another interesting tidbit is the disparate pro-independence factions at work before and after World War II.  There were some who hoped to achieve autonomy by working within the French administration, and there were others who opted for outside efforts. 

This book demonstrates once again why historians are better than journalists.  Neil Sheehan and David Halberstam did wonderful work, but it takes a historian to paint the big picture. 


## Indochina Wars One and Three
Though little more than a chapter each, the histories of the First and Third Indochina War were engrossing. The abrupt surrender of Japan at the end of WWII left France scrambling to reclaim their Indochina colonies. They assumed that everything would revert back to the antebellum status quo, but the Vietnamese had other ideas.  Goscha does note that the UK (India) and the US (Philippines) had a better sense of the impending demise of colonialism than did the French, who saw Indochina as vital to their post-war objectives. That being said, France did con the US into funding their colonial war for them. 

The Third Indochina War is even more interesting. I don't have the book on hand to recapitulate the main argument, but the war resulted from international rivalries among Communist nations.  Soviet Union vs China and Vietnam vs Cambodia.  


## Balance and Context
Goscha compares the Viet pro-independence efforts to those of China and India. Reading this, one can't help but compare Vietnamese trajectory to those of China and Korea. Like the Korean War, the Second Indochina War featured extensive foreign intervention. And like China, there was an intense civil war among the communist and democratic factions.  I can't help but indulge in counterfactual analysis to think how things could have turned out differently.

All in all, an extraordinary book that illuminates not only on Vietnamese history but Southeast Asian history.  

Next, I need to find a good history of Türkiye.
