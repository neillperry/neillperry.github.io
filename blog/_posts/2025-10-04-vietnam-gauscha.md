Dr. [Christopher Goscha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Goscha), a professor of history at the Université du Québec à Montréal, has written an expansive and compelling history of Vietnam.


## Beyond the Second Indochina War
My knowledge of Vietnamese history is confined to the Second Indochina War. A Bright Shining Lie, The Best and The Brightest, and A Grand Dellusion -- these retell the Vietnam War are from the America. Given that broader ignorance, it was fascinating to read up on what happened before the war and what happened after.


## Foreign Intervention 
Goscha's book sweeps more broadly than the American / Vietnam War.  It covers a thousand years of history. In doing so, he identifies several themes that have shaped the birth of that nation. Notably, he focuses on the influence of foreign intervention. China, France, Japan, the United States all shaped the creation of Vietnam. Goscha also talks about Vietnamese colonization. The Viet people migrated south from the Red River delta southward. They also colonized the central highlands, wherein resided non-Viet minorities. 


## Indochina Wars One and Three
Though little more than a chapter each, the histories of the First and Third Indochina War were engrossing. The abrupt surrender of Japan at the end of WWII left France scrambling to reclaim their Indochina colonies. They had no intention of letting Vietnam go. The Third war resulted from international rivalries among Communist nations.


## Balance and Context
Like any good history, this book sets Vietnamese history in the larger international context. He compares the Viet pro-independence efforts to those of China and India. Reading this, I can't help but compare Vietnamese trajectory to those of China and Korea. I can't help but indulge in counterfactual analysis to think how things could have turned out differently.

All in all, an extraordinary book that illuminates not only on Vietnamese history but Southeast Asian history.
