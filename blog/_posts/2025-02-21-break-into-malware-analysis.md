# How to Break Into Reverse Engineering/ Malware Analysis
**February 21, 2025**

This blog post answers the frequently posed question of how to get started in reverse engineering / malware analysis. To break into reverse engineering and malware analysis, you must do the following:

1. Actively Read Everything
2. Take Copious Notes and Create an Outline
3. Follow Along to Video Tutorials
4. Commit to Daily Study

### 1. Actively Read Everything

First, you must read everything you can find on the topic. At the end of this blog post, I have appended a list of books and blog posts you should read. You should read all of them at least once, and you should read some of them several times. Keep in mind that my list is not exhaustive. There are lots more books, blogs, and reports to devour.

I'm going to repeat myself because I fear that you may not understand what I just wrote. You must read. Do not peruse. Don't skim, don't flip through. Certainly don't read while you're texting on your phone. You should read actively. When you read, your entire attention should be directed at the page in front of your face. You will learn nothing through skimming, flipping, perusing, or meandering. You have to read and you have to read actively. When you read a book, think about what you are reading. Try to figure out how you would explain what you are learning to your mother or your dog.

Where do you get all the books? Well, you should start with your local library. Check out all the books that they have on the topic, and read all of them. For books not at your local library, you may have to buy used copies online. No Starch Press publishes some of the books, and they routinely have sales with generous discounts. If you can't afford to buy any of those, don't worry. There are gobs of free resources online, such as blog posts and papers, which I have also linked to below.

### 2. Take Copious Notes and Create an Outline

Second, take copious notes. While you are reading through the books and blogs listed below, you must take notes. This is part of active reading. Take notes on everything you read. Translate what you read into your own words, and put those words in a separate text document or a notebook. Make a list of things you do not understand. If you read a term or concept that you don't understand, go down that rabbit hole until you understand. And at every step in the rabbit hole, take more notes.

Don't just take notes, instead create an outline of everything you read. Organizing all the new information on paper will help your brain organize this new information. Creating an outline will help you remember what you learn. I started studying reverse engineering about a year ago, and so far I have created an 87-page outline of roughly 17,000 words. It has helped me tremendously in understanding the concepts.

### 3. Follow Along to Video Tutorials

Third, you must follow along with the videos. The links below point to helpful YouTube videos, channels, and playlists. You should watch them all. Again, simply playing the video in the background is not enough. Just like in reading, you should dedicate 100% of your attention to the videos. Take notes while you watch the videos. Set up your personal malware analysis lab so that you can download the relevant malware sample and reverse engineering tools and follow along to the video. Hands on experience is a powerful way of learning.

### 4. Commit to Daily Study

Finally, you must commit to daily study. Reading a book or two is insufficient; watching a few YouTube tutorials won't cut it. You need to commit to daily study. You should dedicate at least one hour a day to actively reading books and following along to YouTube tutorials. Learning reverse engineering / malware analysis takes commitment. Your brain stores new information in volatile memory. To transfer that knowledge to long-term memory, you need to study repeatedly. In sum, there is no substitute for consistent effort.

### Conclusion

That is how you get started in reverse engineering / malware analysis. You do it by committing to daily study that includes active reading, copious note-taking, and following along online tutorials. It will take time, but if you persist in your plan you will reach your goal. Good luck.
