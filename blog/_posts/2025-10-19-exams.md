### Pass the GWAPT

I passed the GWAPT web application pentesting exam today. It was underwhelming.  I've never felt so down passing a test. 

In the cybersecurity industry, there are certification exams that gauge a person's knowledge and skill. Some exams are multiple choice, some hands on labs, and some a mix of both.  There are certification exams for general cybersecurity knowledge as well as exams for speicfic subdomains, such as penetration testing, reverse engineering, incident handling. Employers like these exams for the same reason colleges like the SAT. 

Different companies create and administer these exams.  [Amazon Web Services (AWS) has exams](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) that certify proficiency at using AWS products. Microsoft offers similar exams. The exam I took today is part of the [Global Information Assurance Certiifcation (GIAC)](https://www.giac.org/) series. Most of the GIAC exams pertain to cybersecurity.  The one I took focused on pentesting websites.  

To prepare for the exam, I completed a course taught by [the SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security (SANS) Institute](https://sans.org).  My particular course was the [SEC 542: Web App Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/web-app-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking#laptop-requirements) course. This course is geared toward teaching the skills needed for the test. SANS and GIAC enjoy a symbiotic relatoinship in which one creates the class, the oher the exam.  

That SANS course costs $8,780 USD. That is a lot of money; most folks looking to break into or advance in the cybersecurity industry cannot afford that. (My employer paid for my course.)  And the exorbitant tuition is part of the problem.


### Fail the GREM

This was not my first GIAC exam. Last December I sat for, and failed, the [GIAC Reverse Engineering and Malware](https://www.giac.org/certifications/reverse-engineering-malware-grem/) certification exam. 

Unlike the GWAPT, for this exam I did not complete the corresponding SANS course ([FOR610: Reverse-Engineering Malware: Malware Analysis Tools and Techniques](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/reverse-engineering-malware-malware-analysis-tools-techniques)). Instead, I self-studied.

Inspired by [Elias Augusto's example](https://medium.com/@eaugusto/grey-box-testing-how-i-passed-the-giac-grem-exam-without-taking-the-course-fda132d177c30), I tried to pass the exam without paying the $8,780 course fee. To prepare, I spent most of 2024 [reading these books](https://www.neillperry.com/blog/2025/02/21/break-into-malware-analysis) and working through the TCM Security's [Practical Malware Analysis & Triage course](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-malware-analysis-triage) (price was about $30).  

Despite my best efforts, I failed the GREM. I scored a 66%, which was about 4 rights answers short of the minimum score of 71%. My reverse engineering dreams would have to wait a bit. 


### GIAC Exams Test What? 

GIAC exams measure a candidate's ability to look up answers as much as cybersecurity knowledge. You see, GIAC exams are open book, and candidates may bring an armful of books into the testing center. For the GWAPT, I lugged in the 7 SANS notebooks. For the GREM, I brought 3 reverse engineering books and my 10,000 word outline that I curated. 

Passing the GWAPT was discouraging because it was so easy. Armed with my the SEC542 materials, I looked up the answer to every question. I breezed through with an 85% score. The nature of the questions reinforced the perception that someone without the course materials would struggle to pass. 

GIAC exams are not a fair test. A nondisclosure agreement prevents me from disclosing specifics, but the SANS course materials give an unfair advantage to those who have them. (Legally, students who complete a SANS course may not share their SANS materials with others.)  To be fair, Elias Augusto passed on his own, but he is the exception.  

What is especially frustrating is how much deferrence the cybersecurity industry gives GIAC.  It is not uncommon for companies to list GIAC certifications that are required for a job vacancy.   Recruiters will screen out candidates missing those accredidations from their resume. The industry equates the certification with knowledge, when in reality it corresponds to access to expensive SANS courses.

### No Moral Vicotries for Cybersecurity Certification Exams

A vital skill in the tech industry is the ability to self-teach. As both a software engineer and now as a security engineer, I am often asked to tackle projects and tools that require learning new tools, languages, and concepts. And the only path to success is by figuring things out for myself.  Of course, I make copious use of Stack Overflow, Google, and now AI, but I ultimately need to figure it out.

Although I didn't pass the GREM, I developed a pretty strong skill of learning a new domain by myself. 

Unfortunately, perserverance is not something that I can put on my resume. Given the fierce competition in the job market, candidates who have the right certifications will get interviews over those who do not.  


### On to the Next Exam


For now SANS / GIAC remain the dominant certification player, but the competition is proliferating.  I mentioned TCM Security already, and that was a great course. My next course is to enroll in Karsten Hahn's the [Malware Analysis from Intermediate to Expert](https://malwareanalysis-for-hedgehogs.learnworlds.com/) (cost $495). Custom courses offer better value and better instruction. SANS / GIAC still has the name recognition, but hopefully that will change. 

In short, if you are a recruiter from a tech company, you should definitely pass me on to the hiring manager for an interview loop ;)
