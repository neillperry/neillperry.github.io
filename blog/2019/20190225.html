				<h1>THERE IS MORE TO LEADERSHIP THAN INTELLIGENCE</h1>
				<time datetime="2019-02-25">February 25, 2019</time>

				<p>Over the past ten years, two very dissimilar men made very confident assessments of their intelligence. In the run up to the 2016 election, and long afterwards, President Trump maintained that he knows more than his advisors. Similarly, in
					2008 President Obama made a similar remark. “I think that I’m a better speechwriter than my speechwriters. I know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors.”</p>

				<p>I have never met either president, but I have observed managers who regard themselves as they do. Leaders fall for this self-deception because it justifies their status. “I am the smartest, therefore I should be in charge.” Ours is an
					information age and many professions involve highly-specialized expertise, so it’s natural to think that the individual with the most brainpower should be running the show. Plus, it always feel good to seem smart.
					But there is something wrong with this line of reasoning. Actually, there’s several. First, there’s more than one type of intelligence. Second, there’s more to leadership than intelligence. And, finally, leaders should surround themselves
					with people who know more than them. Let’s consider each in turn.</p>

				<p>First, there’s a quote attributed to Jeff Bezos that says, “[t]he older I get the more I realize how many kinds of smarts there are.” In the case of public administration, there will be individuals who are experts on national security, on
					agricultural policy, on healthcare policy, and so on. Just because someone knows a lot about constitutional law or the New York real estate market does not qualify him as an expert in everything. </p>

				<p>Second, there’s more to leadership than intelligence. Leadership is about managing risk, motivating people, mentoring subordinates, and – most importantly – making decisions. It’s also about setting expectations, enforcing accountability,
					and collaborating with peers. None of these skills test out on an IQ test. </p>

				<p>Third, leaders should surround themselves with capable people. If you know more than your advisors, you should go find some better advisors. A leader should surround himself with people who can challenge her thinking and offer different
					perspectives. </p>

				<p>In conclusion, the conductor of a symphony is not in her position because she can play every instrument better than everyone else; she is there because she can lead the players to produce something greater than the sum of their parts. </p>
