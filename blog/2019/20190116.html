				<h1 class="center-block">KNOWLEDGE IS A CHOICE</h1>
				<time datetime="2019-01-16">January 16, 2019</time>

				<p>I believe that knowledge is a choice. I believe that learning is and must be an active endeavor. A person has to make a deliberate choice to obtain knowledge, for intelligence does not occur without consent.</p>

				<p>Knowledge is a choice. This is not an opening line of a freshman philosophy paper; truth is generally not subjective. Instead, I refer to our individual discretion to disbelieve the irrefutable. Just because something is undeniable doesn’t
					mean an individual must or will accept it. Few things are as tasty as a sugary lie. Half-truths and wanton falsehoods are the wellspring of more than a few family fortunes and college endowments.</p>

				<p>Nothing amazes me as much as humanity’s propensity for self-deception. People will delude themselves to no end. Take for instance the very sincere members of the Flat Earth Society. As their name indicates, they proclaim that our world is
					not a huggable globe after all but rather a cold, flat disk, and their persistence against scientific consensus baffles me. This is what I mean when I say that knowledge is a choice: just because something is true doesn’t mean that everyone
					will put their arms around it.</p>

				<p>There are many reasons humans reject knowledge. Perhaps they don’t trust authority figures, maybe they fancy themselves as martyred prophet. Maybe accepting new information implies they are wrong. People really hate feeling stupid, and we
					go to immeasurably lengths to avoid it. It’s why no one likes to ask for directions. Oh, I understand, and I understand completely. I’ve binged on my fair share of lies. For example, I used to believe that I excelled at job interviews. It
					was a source of confidence that I could naturally project competence to strangers and that employers would see my corporate worth. Sadly, I have accepted that this is not in fact the case, and I actually struggle at selling myself for a new
					job. </p>

				<p>A lie is a means of avoiding unwelcome realities, and it often feels better to cocoon oneself in fantasy. Accepting new information can require dismantling presumptions, revisiting assumptions, and admitting to ignorance. I know just how
					scary it can be to raising a hand and ask the dumb questions in class. But there are other barriers to knowledge beside assuaging ego and satisfying pride. </p>

				<p>Knowledge is a choice. Acquiring it requires work – reading and rereading, showing up early, and staying up late – and it demands sacrifice – foregoing hobbies and leisure. Sometimes knowledge requires money, but it always requires time.
					Knowledge is not for the casual or indifferent, and if it is not a priority, then its pursuit will soon be abandoned.
					My mother and father indoctrinated me in the Church of Knowledge, albeit with their individual flavors. My father has a messianic regard for education, which for him offered a lifeline to a better future. My mother, on the other hand, grew
					up in a better environment, so for her education was less about salvation and more about the simple joy of learning. In a different time and place, she might have been a professor, whereas my father is too practical for academia. </p>

				<p>Knowledge is a choice, and learning is an active endeavor. It requires humility to admit that we might be wrong in what we know and it takes courage to accept correction. Knowledge takes work and requires sacrifice, but it’s always worth
					it. </p>
