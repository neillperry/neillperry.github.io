				<h1>Aggression Is (Sometimes) More Important than Skill</h1>
				<time datetime="2019-05-25">May 25, 2019</time>

				<p>Some time ago I got mixed up with a youth soccer team. My role as assistant coach involved more title than responsibility; the head coach had everything under control. What I remember most from my tenure is that our team went undefeated
					that season. The league didn’t recognize our kids as first place, yet ours was the only legitimate claim. The head coach treated us all to a pizza party at the end.</p>

				<p>I refuse all credit for the undefeated season. We ran the kids through basic drills, had them dribble around orange cones, and practice keeping their feet on the ground during throw-ins. They were good athletes to be sure, but so were the
					kids on the opposing teams. So why did my eight and nine-year-olds crush them all?</p>

				<p>Because aggression is (often) more important than skill. Our forwards and midfielders attacked and attacked. They were fearless, relentless, and unscripted. During the games, the head coach would yell commands, but our kids never listened
					to us. They listened to their instinct, and their instinct compelled them in waves against opposing goalkeepers. Of course, winning was a lot of fun.</p>

				<p>In life, as in little league soccer, aggression is more important than skill. Life is not to the most qualified or most capable, but the one willing to risk and go for it. As the <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service">Special Air Service</a> proclaims, “who dares, wins.”</p>

				<p>Recently, I read up on the one of the largest naval battles of all time, the Battle of the Coral Sea. At one point in the battle, a large, stronger Japanese fleet stumbled upon a smaller, weaker American group of ships. Arguably, the
					Japanese fleet should have destroyed the American group (called “Taffy 3”), but didn’t. Historians have endless theories, but the one I've settled on is aggression. Confronted with a superior enemy force, the American destroyers, including
					the <i>Johnston</i>, <i>Roberts</i>, and <i>Hoel</i>, attacked the larger, more powerful ships moving towards them. The three destroyers mentioned were all hit repeatedly and sunk, but not before launching their own attacks.</p>

				<p>Aggression is sometimes more important than skill. Going loud and strong often works to one's advantage.</p>
