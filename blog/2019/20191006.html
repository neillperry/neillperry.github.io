				<h2>Disinformation Needs a Platform</h2>
				<p class="muted">
					<time datetime="2019-10-06">October 6, 2019</time>
				</p>

				<p>In 2018, David Schwartz began tweeting about currents events in Saudi Arabia. This was unusual for two reasons. First, David Schwartz was a weatherman by training, having worked for the Weather Channel for thirty years. Second, Mr.
					Schwartz was dead. He had died two years earlier after a ten-year struggle with cancer. Obviously, the tweets were not from Mr. Schwartz. Instead, they were the work of a person (or persons) who had hacked into his old Twitter account. None
					of this is news. <a href="https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2019/2/25/saudi-trolls-hacking-dead-peoples-twitter-to-spread-propaganda" target="_blank">Marc Owen Jones reported on this</a>, and other zombie Twitter accounts, seven
					months ago. What is worth mentioning is why the hackers did it. And that is because disinformation needs a platform.</p>

				<p>To publish is easy, to get attention is hard. Creating an online soapbox is quick – either on Facebook, Twitter, a blog, or an email newsletter. What is not so quick is earning attention. Generally, there are a couple of ways to do it:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>First, you can steal an audience. As illustrated in the Schwartz case, someone hijacked a a preexisting soapbox. As Jones notes in his article, what made Schwartz’s account especially appealing was its blue checkmark, a Twitter feature
						that indicates a “verified” account. In other words, it lent the account a degree of legitimacy. However, there is a problem with this tactic. Propaganda has to be tailored to its particular audience to be effective. And there is nothing
						to suggest that the Twitter followers of an avuncular weatherman were receptive to tweets about Saudi Arabian politics.</li>

					<li>Second, you can build your own audience. As described in Volume I of the Mueller Report, the Internet Research Agency spent money advertising the Facebook groups they created. They also established accounts that mimicked real
						organizations, such as the Tennessee Republican party. More recently, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/uae-propaganda" target="_blank">Jane Lytvynenko and Logan McDonald reported</a> that Middle Eastern PR
						firms created Twitter accounts posing as fake journalists. Again, like a Twitter blue checkmark, a journalist has an air of legitimacy. This method can be most effective, but the trick is to create communities of like-minded individuals.
						That's what the IRA did in 2015 and 2016. Once you've organized the like-minded communities, then you can inundate them with the tailored disinfomration.</li>

					<li>Third, you can use a journalist’s audience. There is a phenomenon called information washing, in which misinformation is unintentionally adopted by and spread by legitimate news agencies. This is what the Russians, operating through the
						fictitious persona of Guccifer 2.0, did to the American media. In September and October 2016, they released some of the hacked documents from the Democratic National Committee, and the American media covered the content of those
						documents. By releasing the documents, the Russians dictated how the American media covered the Clinton campaign. This last interpretation is <a
							href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/yes-facebook-made-mistakes-in-2016-but-we-werent-the-only-ones/2018/11/17/3b62b422-ea9d-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html/" target="_blank">one advocated by Alex Stamos</a>, former head of
						Facebook security. "[I]n the summer of 2016, every major media outlet rewarded the hackers of the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) with thousands of collective stories drawn from the stolen emails of prominent Democrats."</li>
