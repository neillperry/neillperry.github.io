		<h1>Intuitive Is Hard</h1>
		<time datetime="2019-03-20">March 20, 2019</time>

		<p>In the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250194466">Creative Selection</a>, Ken Kocienda writes about his time as a software developer at Apple. Specifically, he focuses on his contributions to the Safari web browser, WebKit word processing, and iPhone digital keyboard. Each chapter follows the standard formula of how he ended up working on that particular feature, the challenges he encountered, how he solved them, and the lessons he gleaned from that experience. Overall, the book is short, its writing clear, and it enlivens the story of software development.</p>

		<p>The history of the iPhone keyboard seems ill-suited for good drama, but Kocienda tells it well. First, he describes the state of technology at the time. Before the iPhone release in 2007, BlackBerry phones dominated the market. Yet unlike the Blackberry with its hardware keyboard, the new iPhone intended to rely on an entirely digital keyboard. This design enabled the iPhone to have a greater screen size, which in turn would make the iPhone more versatile. This design was also extremely challenging to implement. For starters, the human finger is three times fatter than a single iPhone keyboard button.</p>

		<p>Kocienda excels at describing the challenges of creating an intuitive, easy-to-use digital keyboard. For the keyboard, he includes illustrations of early prototypes and guides us through its design evolution. Hindsight impedes an understanding of just how challenging their task was. The iPhone keyboard as we know it now was never obvious to them. It took several iterations to create the solution we have now. (During development, I suspect that several shouting matches took place, none of which made it into the book.) Recall, the iPhone keyboard not only had to work, but it had to work intuitively. Consumers gravitate towards technology that is simple to use. In fact, one thing that Apple has done well is limit choices so as not to confuse its users.</p>

		<p>I highly recommend the book for software developers or anyone interested in the history of technology. For me, its greatest value is dissecting the anatomy of problem-solving and teamwork. As I stated at the beginning, each vignette concludes with lessons learned. I quote one of them here:<p>

		<q>Look for ways to make quick progress. Watch for project stalls that might indicate a lack of potential. Cut corners to skip unnecessary effort. Remove distractions to focus attention where it needs to be. Start approximating your end goal as soon as possible. Maximize the impact of your most difficult effort. Combine inspiration, decisiveness, and craft to make demos.</q>
