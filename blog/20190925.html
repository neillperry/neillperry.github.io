			<h2>Information Operations</h2>
			<p class="muted">

      <p>The American Revolutionary War began with the battle of Concord and Lexington on April 19, 1775. In his excellent new book <a href="https://revolutiontrilogy.com/books/the-british-are-coming/" target="_blank">The British Are Coming</a>, Rick Atkinson documents the decision of the Americans to quickly seize the narrative around the battle. Three days after the attack, Massachusetts patriots began gathering witness accounts and publishing them in colonial newspapers. The propaganda that they pushed was that the British were the aggressors, and the colonials were the innocents.</p>

			<blockquote class="blockquote">
				<p class="mb-0">"A swift American schooner, the <i>Quero</i>, sailed from Salem for England on April 29 carrynig recent copies of the <i>Essex Gazette</i>, wiht an article that began "Last Wednesday, the 19th of April, the Troops of his Britannick Majesty commenced Hostilities upon the People of this Province." The cargo also included eyewitness depositions and a corroborative statement from a captured British officer. Warren admoished the skipper, Captain John Derby, to keep the voyate "a profound secret from every person on earth." After an unmolested crossing in just twenty-nine days, Derby delivered his packet in London, where the accounts appeared in the three-penny <i>Evening Post</i> to be read by, among others, George III and Lord North."</p>

			<h5>Information Operations</h5>

			<p>This anecdoate demonstrates one form of information operations. At a basic level, the early Americans disseminated facts that supported their narrative that the British Army were the aggressors. They distributed witness statements throughout the colonies, and they ensured that their version arrived first in Europe. Because then, as now, the first reports is the one that typically dominates the media attention.</p>

			<p>American <a href="https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp1_ch1.pdf" target="_blank"> military doctrine</a> considers information as one of the instruments of national power. The U.S. Defense Department (DOD) "operates in a dynamic age of interconnected networks and evolving social media platforms," and it recognizes the need to align its message actions with its statements. In a separate publication, the DOD describes its concept of 'Information Operations.' <a href="https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp3_13.pdf" target="_blank">Joint Publication 3-13</a> describes information operations (IO) as the actions intended to "influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision making of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting our own."</p>

			<p>The Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election ignited a surge of interest in foreign information and influence operations. In much the same way that the 9/11 terrorist attacks spurred interest in terrorism, the activities of the Russian company Internet Research Agency has called attention to the realities of IO campagigns. In the past three years, national and international governments, organizations, and think tanks have increased their attention to this phenomenon. IO is of particular interest to social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. The media usually focuses on the concepts of misinformation and disinformation. These terms refer to the mistaken sharing of wrong information and the intentional sharing of wrong information, respectively. While these are certainly both problems, the topic of this blog focuses on the larger concept of information operations, which comprehends both those activities.</p>

			<p>When discussing IO, one of the first things to understand is the information environment. This is a common mental model that describes how society and human beings collect, access, disseminate, and interpret information. As a model, it's a simplified understanding of abstract and complex phenomena. The model says that the environment has three main components: cognitive, physical, and information. Let's look at them in turn:</p>

			<ol>
        <li><h6><u>Cognitive</u></h6>: the cognitive realm of the Information Environment is what happens inside someone's head. It's how a human understands and processes information. It includes things such as critical thinking, logical fallacies, cultural nomrs, political beliefs, hueristics, etc. A major engine in the cognitive realm is confirmation bias, or the tendency to interpret or recall information that affirms one's existing beliefs. </li>

        <li><h6><u>Physical</u></h6>: the physical realm includes anything that is tangible, such as computers, televisions stations, web servers, telephone networks, antennas, modems, WiFi, books. It also includes human beings, such as television news anchors, anchors, blog writers. As US <a href="https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp3_13.pdf">military doctrine</a> describes it, the physical dimensions is "where physical platforms and the communications networks that connect them reside."</li>

        <li><h6><u>Information</u></h6>: at last, the information dimension is the information, facts, data, lies, misinformation, and disinformation that is swirling all about. Note: if you ever start talking to an Information Operations person, they will get a littled peeved if you confuse the terms misinformation with disinformation.</li>

      </ol>

			<p>Information is an instrument of power. Its use is not limited to nation states, for even non-state actors, businesses, and criminal networks employ it.  The control of information and the maniuplation of its spread is one way to affect behavior. Information can be truthful, misleading, spinned, slanted, or outright false. Understanding the informaiton environment is a prerequisite for curtailing foreign misinformation and effectively employing domestic informations systems for good. In future blog posts, I hope to cover more in depth recent trends and topics on IO.</p>
