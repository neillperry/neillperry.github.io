      <p>The American Revolutionary War began with the battle of Concord and Lexington on April 19, 1775. In his excellent new book <a href="https://revolutiontrilogy.com/books/the-british-are-coming/">The British Are Coming</a>, Rick Atkinson documents the decision of the Americans to quickly seize the narrative around the battle. Three days after the attack, Massachusetts patriots began gathering witness accounts and publishing them in colonial newspapers. The propaganda that they pushed was that the British were the aggressors, and the colonials were the innocents.</p>

			<p>A swift American schooner, the <i>Quero</i>, sailed from Salem for England on April 29 carrynig recent copies of the <i>Essex Gazette</i>, wiht an article that began "Last Wednesday, the 19th of April, the Troopsof his Britannick Majesty commenced Hostilities upon the People of this Province." The cargo also included eyewitness depositions and a corroborative statement from a captured British officer. Warren admoished the skipper, Captain John Derby, to keep the voyate "a profound secret from every person on earth." After an unmolested crossing in just twenty-nine days, Derby delivered his packet in London, where the accounts appeared in the three-penny <i>Evening Post</i> to be read by, among others, George III and Lord North.</p>

			<h5>Problem</h5>
				<p>Research that is not read is wasted. To influence decisions, the Hoover Institution needs the attention of government officials and policy makers. However, compared to its peers, the Insitution lags behind in social media followers and website traffic. The table to below lists out the number of followers for think tanks and the Foreign Policy and Foreign Affairs publications. (Note: the Brookings Institution has a separate Twitter account for its foreign policy division.)</p>

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
  				<p class="mb-0">The next table [edit: omitted] compares web traffic of think tanks, blogs, and the two journals just mentioned. This information is compiled by Amazon’s Alexa division, which monitors global web traffic. In this table, the lower the ranking, the more visitors to a website. As can be seen from the table, the Hoover website lags below other think tanks. And somewhat of significance, the Hoover Institution lags behind the web traffic of two blogs – Lawfare and War on the Rocks – which were created in the last ten years. Newer institutions are passing the Hoover Institution by. </p>

			<h5>Information Operations</h5>

			<p>The Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election has touched a surge of interest in information operations, in much the same way that 9/11 spurred interest in terrorism and the OPM hack ignited cybersecurity. As with all these trends, there has been a lot insightful commentary, and there's been a lot of thought-leading nonsense. I am neither a thought leader or an expert on information operations, sometimes abbreviated IO, but I am fascintated by it. In a previous job, I was lucky enough to stumble into a two-week crash course on the topic.</p>

			<p>When discussing IO, one of the first things to understand is the information environment. This is a common mental model that describes how society and human beings collect, access, disseminate, and interpret information. As a model, it's a simplified understanding of abstract and complex phenomena. The model says that the environment has three main components: cognitive, physical, and information. Let's look at them in turn:</p>

			<ol>
        <li><h6><u>Cognitive</u></h6>: the cognitive realm of the Information Environment is what happens inside someone's head. It's how a human understands and processes information. It includes things such as critical thinking, logical fallacies, cultural nomrs, political beliefs, hueristics, etc. A major engine in the cognitive realm is confirmation bias, or the tendency to interpret or recall information that affirms one's existing beliefs. </li>

        <li><h6><u>Physical</u></h6>: the physical realm includes anything that is tangible, such as computers, televisions stations, web servers, telephone networks, antennas, modems, WiFi, books. It also includes human beings, such as television news anchors, anchors, blog writers. As US <a href="https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/pubs/jp3_13.pdf">military doctrine</a> describes it, the physical dimensions is "where physical platforms and the communications networks that connect them reside."</li>

        <li><h6><u>Information</u></h6>: at last, the information dimension is the information, facts, data, lies, misinformation, and disinformation that is swirling all about. Note: if you ever start talking to an Information Operations person, they will get a littled peeved if you confuse the terms misinformation with disinformation.</li>

      </ol>

			<p>Information is a instrument of national power. It is a means for nations to exert influence on foreign audiences. The information can be truthful, slanted, or outright false. Understanding the informaiton environment is a prerequisite for curtailing foreign misinformation and effectively employing domestic informations systems for good. In future blog posts, I hope to cover more in depth recent trends and topics on IO.</p>
