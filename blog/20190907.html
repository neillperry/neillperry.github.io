			<h1>Improving the Hoover Institution's National Security Program</h1>
			<p class="muted">
				<time datetime="2019-09-07">September 7, 2019</time>
			</p>

			<p>Recently, I interviewed for a program manager position with the Hoover Institution. As part of that process, I researched the think tank and brainstormed some ideas of what I would do if hired and wrote a rought draft. They did not hire me, but I'll go ahead and share my insights here.</p>

			<h3>Problem</h3>
				<p>Research that is not read is wasted. To influence decisions, the Hoover Institution needs the attention of government officials and policy makers. However, compared to its peers, the Insitution lags behind in social media followers and website traffic. The table to below lists out the number of followers for think tanks and the Foreign Policy and Foreign Affairs publications. (Note: the Brookings Institution has a separate Twitter account for its foreign policy division.)</p>

			 	<table style="width:25%">
				  <tr>
				    <th>Twitter Handle</th>
				    <th>Followers</th>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>Heritage</td>
				    <td>652,000</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>CFR</td>
				    <td>407,800</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>Cato Institute</td>
				    <td>360,100</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>CSIS</td>
				    <td>282,900</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>Lawfare Blog</td>
				    <td>202,300</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>Brookings FP</td>
				    <td>157,100</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>Hoover</td>
				    <td>107,100</td>
				  </tr>
				</table>

				<p>The next table [edit: omitted] compares web traffic of think tanks, blogs, and the two journals just mentioned. This information is compiled by Amazon’s Alexa division, which monitors global web traffic. In this table, the lower the ranking, the more visitors to a website. As can be seen from the table, the Hoover website lags below other think tanks. And somewhat of significance, the Hoover Institution lags behind the web traffic of two blogs – Lawfare and War on the Rocks – which were created in the last ten years. Newer institutions are passing the Hoover Institution by. </p>

				<p>The rest of this paper will offer possible solutions on how the Hoover Institution can increase its visibility and influence. <p>
 
			<h3>CASE STUDY</h3>

			<p>Before moving to the list of suggestions, it is important to consider the case study of the Lawfare Blog. In 2010, two law professors and a former Washington Post editor created the website to publish analysis on the intersection of law and national security. Since then, the blog has grown stupendously. It incorporates content from a diverse team of national security former ambassadors, high-ranking members of the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, and law students. </p>

			<p>The Lawfare Blog offers timely analysis. On August 15, 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump had expressed interest in buying Greenland. By 1:15pm on August 16, the Lawfare Blog had an article from Scott Anderson, a former staff attorney with the Office of the Legal Advisor with the U.S. State Department.  Anderson explained the legal and political road blocks to such a purchase.

			<p>The website has a layout style that mimics the layout of an online newspaper, with a masthead, a horizontal navigation bar underneath with subtopics, followed by columns of clickable article headlines. On the far-right column, the website lists recent Lawfare podcasts. These design features orient the visitor to the layout and facilitate reading. </p>

			<p>In sum, the Lawfare Blog has been remarkably successful. In nine years, it has inserted itself into the conversation.</p>

				<h4>Emphasize Original Content</h4>
				The biggest difference between the Hoover Institution and the other organizations analyzed above is the presence of organic content. All the others create and host original content on their websites. This content consists of book reviews, essays, articles, and week in reviews. The Hoover Institution largely does not. Most of the Hoover Institution’s website consists of links to external entities, such as opinion pieces authored by Fellows. I believe that this is the biggest impediment to Hoover’s weak internet presence. Without original content, there is no reason to visit the Hoover Institution.

				The Hoover Institution should create original content just for its website. This content will attract readers and build its audience. The content will need to be timely and relevant. For example, Lawfare Blog had a post on the Greenland issue within a day of it becoming a headline.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Take Advantage of Stanford University Students</h4>
				To generate original content, the Hoover Institution should take advantage of the expertise of the student body. There are many exceptionally talented students – undergraduate and graduate – at Stanford University who would welcome the opportunity to write on issues of foreign policy and national security. We might even be able to convince some students at UC Berkeley to write for us.
				The Fellows of the Hoover Institution cannot possibly write all the original content that we will need. We can fill in the gaps by using qualified students and contributors.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Program Specific Webpage</h4>
				The Hoover Institution should create a website dedicated to its foreign policy and national security division. This page will showcase the original content that we generate. To increase readability, we should mimic the layout of a newspaper or journal. We should also organize old posts by topic areas to allow people to explore areas of interest. We want a website that people will visit repeatedly.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Take Advantage of Silicon Valley</h4>
				The Hoover Institution should take advantage of its proximity to Silicon Valley. The large tech companies of San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Menlo Park, and Mountain View are having a global impact. Current and former employees of this companies have perspectives and expertise worth sharing. The large tech companies affect American foreign policy. Their Chinese counterparts – Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu– are also having a global impact.
			</li>
		</ol>


		<p>And that's where the essay dies out. I was going to add a section about creating a National Security Division podcast and newsletter. Bottom line is that to remain relevant the Hoover Institution will have to do a better job of adapting to the media environment. </p>

		<p>I would also like to state that while the Hoover Institution's National Security Division should adopt some of the practices of the Lawfare Blog, it definitely should not copy it. It should find its own voice and its own angle. Lawfare Blog is successful because it has a specific brand, and it does an effective job of marketing its original content. </p>
