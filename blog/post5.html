<h1>No Growth Without Feedback</h1>
<time datetime="2019-03-20">March 20, 2019</time>

<p>In their book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Superforecasting-Science-Prediction-Philip-Tetlock/dp/0804136718">Superforecasting: the Art and Science of Predicting</a>, Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner describe individuals who are exceptionally adept at predicting future events. These superforecasters do not wield psychic abilities but rather excel at estimating probabilities using publicly available information. The book explores how to make accurate forecasts, but for purposes of this post I wanted to lock in on their criticism of the U.S. intelligence community. They argue that the intelligence community fails to improve the accuracy of its forecasting because they never pause and reflect on past performance.</p>

<p>“Even the $50 billion question – How accurate are the forecasts of intelligence analysts? – can’t be answered. Of course, some think they know. Senior officials may claim that the [intelligence community] is right 80% or 90% of the time. But these are just guesses. Like nineteenth-century physicians who were sure that their treatments cured patients 80% or 90% of the time, they may be right, or close to right, or very wrong. <b>Absent accuracy metrics, there is no meaningful way to hold intelligence analysts accountable for accuracy.</b>”</p> 

<p>(emphasis added). They go on to note that failure to grade past work is not limited to just intelligence analysts. “The list of organizations that produce or buy forecasts without bothering to check for accuracy is astonishing.”</p> 

<p>There is a similar phenomenon at work with decisionmaking. Although most of us are not intelligence analysts or meteorologists, we make decisions. Lots of decisions. And like those in the prediction business, we should take time to reflect on the decisions we made for there is no growth without feedback.</p> 

<p>Imagine going to school and never receiving any grades on homework or tests. You would struggle to gauge your progress or identify areas of improvement. Instead, you would receive meaningless participation trophies. Life is a “grade your own test” adventure. No one checks your work nor does anyone issue you a report card ever few months. If you are fortunate, you will encounter mentors and make friends who provide feedback on how you’re doing.</p> 
	
<p>“Good job on the quarterly report, Janine!”</p>

<p>“Next time maybe try letting the cake cool before icing it, Neill.”</p> 

<p>“You are the greatest person who ever lived!”</p> 

<p>Okay, so maybe no one ever tells us that last one, but you get the drift. It is largely up to us to assess the quality of our decisions. But feedback – like freedom – isn’t free. It takes time to self-reflect, a little bit of guts, and a sense of perspective. Reflecting on past decisions requires time we could be doing something else. It also takes courage to be honest with yourself and realize that you could have done things better. Finally, feedback requires balance. When you judge yourself, you need to be fair without being harsh. Learn from your mistakes but don’t dwell on them.</p> 

<p>You need to assess your past decisions because without feedback you will not improve. It’s like practicing the piano with cotton-stuffed ears. If you can’t hear how you are playing, you cannot assess your technique. Otherwise, we are left repeating the same mistakes again and again.<p>  

<p>Now if you will excuse me, I have a cake to ice.</p>
