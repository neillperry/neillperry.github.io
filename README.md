# Personal Website

Everyone needs a good website, and this one is mine. The website is bear's bones. There's a blog for cybersecurity studies, a modest photo album, and a reading list. There's also links to my social media handles. 

 If you are reading this, then I encourage you to make your own website using free services from Github Pages and Cloudfare hosting. It's really easy and inexpensive.
