			<p>Hello, welcome to my website. This is a project that I started to learn web development. The project has come a long way in the last three years, and it's still a work in progress. If you want to see how bad I was at first, you can dig up earlier versions of this project in my GitHub profile. The story of this website is the story of my efforts to learn software development. About four years ago, I had plateued in my career, and I started looking for new challenges. At the time, there was a growing trend toward coding bootcamps. I had done some coding back in the day in the old BASIC language, and I thought I would give it a shot. </p>

			<p>A secondary purpose of this website is to house my blog and photos. At various points, I have abandoned this do-it-yourself website in favor of commercial website services such as Squarespace and WordPress. However, each time that I have signed up, I was ultimately dissatisfied with what they offered. I am sometimes a perfectionist, and it bothered me that I could not tweak their templates to my own preferences. So each time I came back to this website and learned some more Bootstrap to implement the design features that I wanted out of my blog. A somewhat related problem is teh privacy protections of Instagram. Although I have Instagram account, I generally do not post there because I distrust the Facebook overlords. So this website is also designed to house the pictures that I take.</p>

			<p>I have definitely learned a lot on this project. I learned about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">First and Second Browser Wars</a>, WebKit and browser engines, DNS settings, and flexboxes. I'm still mastering that last one. In any event, it's been fun.</p>

			<hr>

			<p>The third purpose of this website is to look for a job. I am still looking for a job that is challenging, that involves working nice people, and that requires learning new and challenging things. That's a fairly broad statement and a nice way of saying I still don't know exactly what I want. But if you are reading this and know of a position that would challenging and rewarding, by all means hit me up or forward my contact info to a hiring manager.</p>

			<hr>

			<p>Finally, this About page doubles as a Contact page. I would say that I love getting email from fans, but no one has ever sent me anything. Please feel free to contact me if you want. My Twitter profile is in the footer below, and you can find me on LinkedIn effortlessly.</p>
