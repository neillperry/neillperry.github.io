				<p>Hello, welcome to my website. This is a project that I started to learn web development. The project has come a long way in the last three years, and it's still a work in progress. If you want to see how bad I was at first, you can dig up
					earlier versions of this project in my GitHub profile. The story of this website is the story of my efforts to learn software development. About four years ago, I had plateued in my career, and I started looking for new challenges. At the
					time, there was a growing trend toward coding bootcamps. I had done some coding back in the day in the old BASIC language, and I thought I would give it a shot. </p>

				<p>Although there are easier ways to build a personal website, doing it myself has been the most effective path for learning web development. Companies such as Squarespace and Wordpress allow you to quickly construct a personal website. For a
					little bit more control, one could deploy a content management system using Netifly. As useful as those products are, I have found that nothing reinforces learning than doing it myself. Writing my own robots.txt and CNAME files helps me
					remember what those files do. Besides, it's not terribly hard to copy and paste some HTML and CSS code from W3 Schools.</p>

				<p>A secondary purpose of this website is to house my blog and photos. At various points, I have abandoned this do-it-yourself website in favor of commercial website services such as Squarespace and WordPress. However, each time that I have
					signed up, I was ultimately dissatisfied with what they offered. I am sometimes a perfectionist, and it bothered me that I could not tweak their templates to my own preferences. So each time I came back to this website and learned some more
					Bootstrap to implement the design features that I wanted out of my blog. A somewhat related problem is the privacy protections of Instagram. Although I have an Instagram account, I generally do not post there because I distrust the Facebook
					overlords. So this website also houses my pictures.</p>

				<p>I have definitely learned a lot on this project. I learned about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First and Second Browser Wars</a>, WebKit and browser engines, DNS
					settings, and flexboxes. I'm still mastering that last one. In any event, it's been fun.</p>

				<p>I would say that I love getting email from fans, but no one has ever sent me anything. Please feel free to contact me if you want. My Twitter profile is in the footer below, and you can
					find me on LinkedIn effortlessly.</p>
